## Objective:
This project aims to leverage Power BI for a comprehensive analysis of Uber trip data. The goal is to provide key stakeholders with a dynamic, data-driven dashboard that offers insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency, enabling them to optimize operations, pricing, and resource allocation.

## Overview:
The solution consists of three interactive dashboards: an Overview Analysis dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), a Time Analysis dashboard to uncover temporal patterns in trip demand, and a Details Tab for granular, drill-through data exploration. The dashboards feature dynamic measures, interactive filters, and advanced visualizations to provide a 360-degree view of Uber's business operations.
