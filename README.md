![Uber Logo](https://github.com/Nimisha-Soni/Uber-Trip-Analysis/blob/main/1659761100uber-logo-png.png)

## Objective:
This project aims to leverage Power BI for a comprehensive analysis of Uber trip data. The goal is to provide key stakeholders with a dynamic, data-driven dashboard that offers insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency, enabling them to optimize operations, pricing, and resource allocation.

## Overview:
The solution consists of three interactive dashboards: an Overview Analysis dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), a Time Analysis dashboard to uncover temporal patterns in trip demand, and a Details Tab for granular, drill-through data exploration. The dashboards feature dynamic measures, interactive filters, and advanced visualizations to provide a 360-degree view of Uber's business operations.

## Key Features:
### Dynamic Interactivity:
The project features a dynamic measure selector that allows users to switch between different KPIsâ€”Total Bookings, Total Booking Value, and Total Trip Distance. This, combined with interactive slicers, provides a highly customizable and intuitive user experience for analyzing Uber trip data.

### Comprehensive Analysis Framework:
The dashboard uses a three-tab structure to provide a multi-faceted view of operations. The Overview tab covers high-level KPIs and location insights, the Time Analysis tab reveals temporal patterns, and the Details Tab offers drill-through functionality for granular data exploration.

### Actionable Insights and Visualization:
The dashboard is designed to deliver clear, actionable insights through various visuals. Conditional formatting highlights performance variations, and charts identify peak demand periods and top-performing locations. The project aims to help optimize pricing and improve driver allocation.

### User-Friendly Enhancements:
The project includes several usability features, such as a "Clear Slicer" button for quick resets, a "Data Details" bookmark for metric explanations, and a "Download Raw Data" button that gives users the flexibility to export data for further analysis.

|The Overview Analysis dashboard reveals key booking trends and revenue metrics. We can see peak booking values and trip patterns, helping to identify high-traffic times and locations. | The Time Analysis dashboard provides a deeper look into temporal patterns of trip demand. By analyzing bookings in 10-minute intervals and across days of the week, we can pinpoint peak and off-peak hours.|

### Insights from Time Analysis Dashboard
The Time Analysis dashboard provides a deeper look into temporal patterns of trip demand. By analyzing bookings in 10-minute intervals and across days of the week, we can pinpoint peak and off-peak hours. This data is critical for dynamic pricing strategies and ensuring optimal driver availability during high-demand periods.

### Insights from Details Tab Dashboard
The Details Tab dashboard acts as a powerful tool for granular data exploration. By using drill-through functionality, users can dive into the specifics of any trip, vehicle type, or location. This capability allows for in-depth root-cause analysis and provides a complete view of the data, which is essential for detailed operational planning.
